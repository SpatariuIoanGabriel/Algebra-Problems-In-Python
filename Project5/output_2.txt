1. The elements of the group (S3, ◦) are:

e = (1, 2, 3)
    (1, 2, 3)

σ1 = (1, 2, 3)
     (1, 3, 2) = (2 3)

σ2 = (1, 2, 3)
     (2, 1, 3) = (1 2)

σ3 = (1, 2, 3)
     (2, 3, 1) = (1 2 3)

σ4 = (1, 2, 3)
     (3, 1, 2) = (1 3 2)

σ5 = (1, 2, 3)
     (3, 2, 1) = (1 3)

2. The orders of the elements of the group (S3, ◦) are:

ord(e) = 1
ord(σ1) = 2
ord(σ2) = 2
ord(σ3) = 3
ord(σ4) = 3
ord(σ5) = 2
